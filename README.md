## Problem Statement

## Data Dictionary

The dataset for this project can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset?rvi=1

|**glioma**| glioma folder in training and testing folders | Date the reddit post was created 

|**meningioma**| meningioma folder in training and testing folders | Title of the reddit post

|**no tumor**| no tumor folder in training and testing folders | clean scan not showing any tumors

|**pituitary**| pituitary folder in training and testing folders | Text of the reddit post

## Executive Summary

### Preprocessing

## Models 

Four models were created in the process of trying to find the best one for this project.

1) 

2) 

3) 

4) 

### Metrics
Various metrics were performed on all four models to compare how well the models performed.

#### Baseline Score
The baseline score is used to find the most basic model possible and how it will perform against the data we have. We can compare the rest of our metrics to the baseline score to get an idea of how well our model performed.

#### Precision
The precision score was found on the test data against the predicted data for all of the models. The precision score tells you of all the positives that were predicted in the dataset, how many of them were actually positive.

#### Recall
The recall score was found on the testing data against the predicted data for all the models. This score tells you of all the positives in the data, how many the model correctly predicted.

#### f1 Score
The f1 score was found of the testing data against the predicted data for the all of the models. This score finds an overall score for your model by taking a balance between your precision and recall score.

#### Confusion Matrix
A confusion matrix shows the values of the True Positives, False Negatives, False Positives, and True Negatives. Confusion matrices were created for all four models and played a factor in deciding which model was the best for this project.
